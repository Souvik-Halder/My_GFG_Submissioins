//Same Logic this code I have submitted in C++ because in java I am unable to access the methods
//of the Queue for Insertion and Deletion written in the programme So i have submitted the 
//C++ Logic
// Function to reverse first k elements of a queue.

    stack<int> st;
    int rem = q.size() - k;
    //pushing the elements of the  queue to the stack upto k
    while(!q.empty() && k--)
    {
        st.push(q.front());
        q.pop();
    }
    //pushing back the elements from stack to queue upto when the stack is not empty
    while(!st.empty())

        q.push(st.top());
        st.pop();
    }
    //For the size()-k element to push in the back of the queue
    //As if the size of the queue is 5 and the k is 3 and the element of the queue is 12345
    //Then if we don't write the below code the result will be 45321 
    //so the 4 and 5 should be present in last so we pop and push them to the end as this is a queue there are two different ends for the pop and push element
    //so 4 and 5 goes to the last end;
    while(!q.empty() && rem--)
